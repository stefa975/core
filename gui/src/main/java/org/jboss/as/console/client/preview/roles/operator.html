<h1>Operator</h1><p>The Operator role extends the Monitor role by adding the ability to modify the runtime state of the server. This means that Operators can reload and shut down the server as well as pause and resume JMS destinations. The Operator role is ideal for users who are responsible for the physical or virtual hosts of the application server so they can ensure that servers can be shut down and restarted correctly when needed. Operators cannot modify server configuration nor access sensitive data or operations.</p>
