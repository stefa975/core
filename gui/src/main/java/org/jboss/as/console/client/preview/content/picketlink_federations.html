<div class='preview-content'><h1>PicketLink Federations</h1>
    <p>The PicketLink subsystem allows you to configure and deploy identity providers (IDP) and service providers (SP), which are grouped together in a federation.</p>
    <p>A federation can be understood as a circle of trust from which applications share common configurations, such as certificates and SAML-specific configurations. Each participating domain is trusted to accurately document the processes used to identify a user, the type of authentication system used, and any policies associated with the resulting authentication credentials.</p>
    <p>Each federation has one IDP and many SPs.</p>
