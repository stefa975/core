    <h1>JMS Bridge</h1>
    <p>A JMS bridge consumes messages from a source JMS destination and sends them to a target JMS destination, typically on a different server.</p>

    <p>The bridge can also be used to bridge messages from other non-Artemis JMS servers, as long as they are JMS 1.1 compliant.</p>
