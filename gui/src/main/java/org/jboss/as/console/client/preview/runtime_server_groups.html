    <h1>Server Groups</h1>
    <p>A server group is set of server instances that will be configured and managed as one. In a managed domain, every application server instance is a member of a server group, even if there is only a single server in a server group.</p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the domain controller and the host controllers to ensure that all servers in a server group have a consistent configuration. All server instances use the same profile and have the same deployment content.</p>
