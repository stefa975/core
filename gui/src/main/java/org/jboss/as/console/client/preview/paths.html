    <h1>Paths</h1>
    A path is a logical name for a file system path. Other areas of the configuration can then reference the path using the logical name instead of the full path, which may vary on different machines. There are several predefined paths in use by the default configuration, such as the <span style="font-family: monospace">jboss.server.log.dir</span> path that defines the directory for the server log.
