    <h1>Interfaces</h1>
    <p>An interface is a logical name for a network interface, IP address, or host name to which sockets can be bound. Other areas of the configuration can then reference the interface by its logical name instead of providing the full details, which may vary on different machines. An interface configuration also specifies criteria for resolving the actual physical address to use.</p>
